    "# Binance Live Trading Code\n",
    "This is an incredibly simple, yet theoretically effective live code for trading a given cryptocurrency pair. The purpose of this code is to illustrate the work that goes into developing an effective and highly robust live code. The actually trading logic is one line of code, however the entire file is more than much longer due to the additional features which support live trading.\n",

    "## Strategy and Pitfal\n",
    "if(spread >= cost of trading): trade  \n",
    "The strategy is aptly named Spread Abuser. It is a HFT code even when run at slow time steps (eg. 1, 2, 5 min). If you backtest this strategy it will often give *theoretical* returns over 100% on many currency pairs.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The major pitfal of this strategy (and if there wasn't one I wouldn't post the code) is that it fails to move volume effectively. Most orders it puts out will not fulfill and the ones that do are usually the losing trades (margins are tight here). Cryptocurrency markets are relatively illiquid compared to tradition stock markets and there may come a day when that is not the case, however more liquidity most likely will come with smaller spreads which make this strategy more ineffective."

Other times human intuition or knowledge of external factors, things the code won't consider, make you decide to take down a code before a coming market downturn. You could log into AWS and hit control C, but a more elagant and versatile way is to read from the instructions file.  \n",

Elif statements can easily be added for other conditions. For example this strategy's most influential input is the commission rate, but for strategies that take many hyperparameters these could be manually adjusted and then fed into the live code to be updated here."

    "While manual parameter overwriting via txt instruction file could easily be incorporated into the above code, we normally build this feature directly into the strategy. Most of our successful strategies (which will never see the light of day on GitHub) take several key parameter inputs. We rigorously backtest and optimize to find these and hard code them into our strategies. There are times though where it is more favorable to let the code auto update them.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this case a variable called reset and a function called Parameter_Chooser would be previously defined. Imagine reset is equal to a weeks worth of data points, then the code will update twice a week (every 3.5 days) using a weeks worth of data to backtest. This will give a variable named updatedParameters, which will give has a lot of information in addition to the parameters, such as return, return percentage, number of trades, and winning trade percentage. From this we select the parameters as a variable named chosenParameters, which would overwrite chosenParameters defined in the Settings. Both are printed and recorded so that we can see the parameters as well as their performance in backtesting."

    "Fortunately this strategy only needs to store one data point at a time. Most other strategies need to store much larger amounts of data and if many codes (sometimes we run two different strategies over several currency pairs all simultaneously) are running at once this could begin to use up AWS memory. Most actual strategies we use tend to require about 50-250 data points at a time and perhaps several thousand if auto updating is included. Ever so often we trim the data to make sure DataFrames, Series, and arrays don't grow indefinitely. Below is sample code for this feature."
