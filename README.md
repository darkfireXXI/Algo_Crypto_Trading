# Algo_Crypto_Trading
All Things Related to Algorithm Trading Cryptocurrency  

##  Motivation
In July/August of 2017 I bought $50 worth of Ethereum. I held and did 15% in a week and quickly added more money. Soon after I had put the majority of my internship savings into cryptocurrency and was actively day trading. I was in my final year of engineering graduate school and when the semester resumed I couldn't help but think that surrounded by all these supposedly intelligent people I should be able take this to the next level: algorithm trading.  

I knew some MatLab, but that was the extent of my coding knowledge and my [friend](https://github.com/santhoshetty) was in the same boat. Regardless, 20 days later we had setup an AWS, written some decent trading strategies, and were collecting data live from Bittrex.  

Now, at the time of writing this over a year later, this outgrown hobby as become one of my primary interests. It has also been an incredible learning experience as along the way I have learned a tremendous amount about Computer Science.  

## Why am I posting this now?
Continuing from the previous point though, it is important to note that what I learned for a long time was only in the context of algorithm trading. The singular end goal was to make positive returns in base BTC markets. At the time this was the first and only project I was doing, so everything I wrote I wanted to keep a secret. The idea of posting it on GitHub to be open source was fundamentally illogical. Please note that if you had a code that you could run and make 30% a month (ahh those were the haydays Winter 2017) why would you share that with the world?  

However, I've come to realize the importance of GitHub documentation for friends, strangers, and mostly recruiters to see the previous work I have done. Plus I now have done other coding work which is not secretive, so I have posted some of those as well, but this project dwarfs all the others.
